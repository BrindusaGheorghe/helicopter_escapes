# Helicopter Escapes

* This is a small data science project looking at inmates escaping prison by the use of a helicopter.
* Data used: the Wikipedia page [List of helicopter prison escapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes).
* I analysed the data using Python3 in a Jupyter Notebook, and it was the most fun I had in ages! 
* Please make sure to also use the Helper file, of the first code won't work.
